# Python-Project

This project involves analyzing an employee dataset provided by ABC Company. The dataset contains 458 rows and 9 columns, offering insights into various aspects of employees, such as their age, height, salary, team, and position. Through preprocessing, analysis, and graphical representation, the goal is to derive meaningful insights for the company.

Steps in the Analysis

1. PREPROCESSING
Task: The "height" column was corrected by replacing its values with random numbers between 150 and 180 to ensure data consistency.
Method:
Used Python's random library to generate new height values within the specified range.
Verified the integrity of the dataset after modification.

2. ANALYSIS TASK
-Distribution of Employees Across Teams:
Calculated the number of employees in each team.
Derived the percentage distribution relative to the total employee count.

-Employee Segregation by Position:
Grouped employees based on their positions within the organization.

-Predominant Age Group:
Categorized employees into age groups and identified the group with the highest frequency.

-Highest Salary Expenditure:
Analyzed salary expenditure by team and position to identify the largest contributors.

-Correlation Between Age and Salary:
Examined the relationship between age and salary and represented it visually.

3. GRAPHIC REPRESENTATION
For each analysis task, visualizations were created to present findings effectively:

-Team Distribution:
Bar chart showing the count of employees per team.
Pie chart displaying the percentage split of employees by team.

-Position Segregation:
Horizontal bar chart categorizing employees by position.

-Predominant Age Group:
Histogram highlighting the most common age group.

-Highest Salary Expenditure:
Grouped bar chart comparing salary expenditures by team and position.

-Correlation Between Age and Salary:
Scatter plot visualizing the relationship between age and salary.

4. DATA STORY
The insights derived from the analysis include:

-Team Dynamics:
Certain teams have significantly more employees, suggesting differences in team sizes or roles.

-Position Breakdown:
Positions such as [e.g., "Manager" or "Engineer"] dominate the workforce.

-Age Trends:
Most employees fall within the [e.g., "30-40 years"] age group.

-Salary Insights:
The [e.g., "Engineering team"] incurs the highest salary expenditure, potentially indicating its strategic importance.

-Correlation:
A positive/negative/no correlation was observed between age and salary, providing insights into experience-based salary structures.
